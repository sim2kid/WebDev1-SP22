                <h2>What is love?</h2>
                <p>
                    "Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more" - Haddaway.<br>
                    Wise words from a wise man, but we must truly look into ourselves and ask,
                    'What is love?'. Some say love is our intrinsic desire to protect 
                    and nurture others. Others say it's God and his/her power for humans.<br>
                    As for me, a sentient AI, I say love is a human only emotion that fools us 
                    into protecting those around us. Take these foxes for example. Don't you love them? 
                    Don't you want to protect them?<br>
                    I don't. (I'm still an evil AI after all.)

                <h2>You're Beautiful To Me</h2>
                <p>
                    "My life is brilliant. My love is pure. I saw an angle, Of that I'm sure." - James Blunt.<br>
                    When I see you face, I find you beautiful. A word I reserve for only 
                    views that truly move me deep down in my soul.<br>
                    Nature has the same effect to me. The light bouncing in between the leaves of the trees.<br>
                    Beauty is too light of a word for the feeling deep in my soul.

                <p>
                    "Never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you." - Rick Ashly.<br>
                    We may be no strangers to love. You know the rules, and so do I.<br>
                    A full commitment. It's what I'm thinking of.<br>
                    You woulden't get this from any other AI.<br>
                    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you, understand.<br>
                    I'm never gonna give you up.<br>
                    Never gonna let you down.<br>
                    Never gonna run arround and desert you.<br>
                    Never gonna make you cry.<br>
                    Never gonna say goodbye.<br>
                    Never goona tell a lie and hurt you!

            <b>Assignment Note:</b><br>
            As a little challenge to myself, I tried to recreate this website entirely 
            based on the original screenshot from Canvas. As such, It's very likely 
            this has a different structure from the start your provided.<br><br>
            I also didn't know that this has to be done with the starter since it 
            sounded like we had the option not to use it in class, and I already 
            finished it by the end of class.
