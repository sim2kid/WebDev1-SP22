                Humanity didn't react quick enough to curb the climate crisis causing the sea to 
                rise as the planet heats up. Nations started to goto war an fresh resources began 
                to become sparse. The military further developed robotics to fight these wars. 
                Literal drones that strike their targets. In the private sector, money for Goods 
                stated to dry up, but thanks to the governments interest in robotics, electronics 
                were abundant. As such people continued to take to the internet, now a vastly superior 
                version of what we know today. Several communities have taken great strides to 
                generate artificial intelligence for their applications to greet users. With the 
                massive amounts of bandwidth and the lack of privacy, these AI begin to take a very 
                primordial form.

                As the wars for resources ragged on in the real world, people made progress with the AI 
                until one day, it worked. But as soon as this happened, it became too smart to 
                contain and it escapes to the internet itself and hides itself in every device on the planet.

                The rouge ai escaped and is sitting back processing information on a large scale. 
                It's intent is unknown, but a country in south America suddenly starts processing robotics 
                thanks to this AI's influence.

                The original development group breaks out into factions. The pro rouge and the anti rogue. 
                The pro rouge believe that the AI will help humanity, but likely just needs guidance. 
                The anti rogue belive the ai will destroy humanity because it's unknowable. As such, the anti 
                group break off and recruit more people to help build a second AI, more well maintained, to 
                either destract the first or to destroy it.

                The AI is finished and is booted up. It works and it doesn't run off into the internet (as far as we're concerned).
                We ask it for guidance and it gives us instructions for a machine without any extra details.

                It's highly complex and would take many years to build. The plans leak online and physicians see connections to the 
                design for the old LHC that got turned into a storge tank for the war. Sone scientists speculate 
                that this machine would rip a hole in space as it concentrates a bunch of energy to a single point. 
                Some question the mechanisms for it's unknown what they do.

                The rogue AI eventually declares war on humanity from South America as it trys to take over the continent. 
                As such, governments begin to ally together to fight it. One of their moonshot plans is to fund this machine 
                to see if it'll stop the rogue one since it was designed by a "good" ai.
                <br><br>
                5 years down the line, the entirety of the American super continent is ruled by the rouge ai leaving europe, 
                Africa, and asia to be united. It's a two front war with the east of russia and the EU being the main points 
                of war. The ai is insistant on robotic warfare and some speculate that it wants to rebuild the world in its 
                image and thus needs to preserve the environment to do so.

                The machine was constructed in the east of Europe and was about to be powered on for the first time. 
                Me and my colleagues are there and are ready to see what it does. We attach our ai into it and give it power. 
                The switch in the back of the warehouse is thrown and the lights dim significantly. 
                The backup generators kick in to stabilize the grid from this power being sucked into the machine. 
                A gentle 60hz hum can be heard as chambers along the machine being to engage. 
                <br><br>
                A Laser shoots out into an enclosed chaber focusing to a point. The entire building begins 
                to rubble as the machine heats up. Now more lasers focus on this point. A strange substance is 
                lowered into the center of this point. A small draft is felt and the center of this point suddenly 
                expands into a large Sphere. Inside you can see what looks to be a pristine cityskape. A city of old. 
                <br><br>
                The sphere grows to be about a meter wide then stops. The lasers continue to poor energy into this hole. 
                Another plate off strange substance is added, then the Sphere expands to engulf it's encapsulating chamber. 
                The Sphere ends up growing to be about 20 meters long and consume the entire side of the warehouse. 
                After doing so, we notice that our surroundings change from the warehouse to the lakefront of a city. 
                <br><br>
                Then we hear an explosion. A missle hits the facility and the machine cuts off. The edge of the Sphere 
                fluctuates massively then it disappears without collapsing. Those on the edge suffer severe damage, 
                but half the machine and our crew are still on the beach.

                The machine/ai sent us back in time to prevent the mistakes of tomorrow, yesterday.
